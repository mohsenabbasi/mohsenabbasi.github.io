<h2>Online Unit Clustering and Covering Problem</h2>
<p>In the unit clustering problem, given a set of points on the plane, the goal is to group these points into minimum number of clusters of unit size. 
In the online version, the points arrive one by one and upon each point's arrival, it must be assigned to some cluster.
Another related problem is online unit covering in which moving clusters after opening them is not allowed. 
In this project, the online clustering and online unit covering problems are studied in two dimensional Euclidean space.</p>

<h2>Direction and Range Assignment for Directional Antennae in Wireless Networks</h2>
<p>In recent years, significant interest has been attracted towards using directional antennae
in wireless and sensor networks due to it's decreased energy consumption, increased security
and decreased radio wave overlapping. The problem is not polynomially solvable
in general and effort has been made in recent years to present approximation algorithms to
solve this problem. In this project, the problem is studied in one dimension.</p>

<h2>Mechanism Design for Single-Service Peer to Peer Networks</h2>
<p>Peer to peer systems support many diverse applications such as file sharing, distributed computation, multimedia streaming and etc 
yet they all share a basic feature; The foundation of peer-to-peer systems is based on the contribution of resources from peers and 
such contribution plays a significant role in the efficiency and performance of the system. <br />
Much of the existing designs in peer to peer networking assume obedient users which follow prescribed protocols without deviation 
yet users of these networks usually are automated rational agents who try to maximize their utility which leads to a tendency to freeride.<br />
In this project, in order to overcome the problems described before in such systems, a model of a single service peer to peer network is 
presented which considers such system as a step by step prisoners&rsquo; dilemma game. Also, some simulations were implemented which their results 
show altruism behavior among the agents as predicted in model analysis.</p>
